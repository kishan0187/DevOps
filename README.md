📈 Stock Market Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict stock prices using machine learning and deep learning models. It includes data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
Models such as LSTM, Random Forest, ARIMA, or Prophet can be used depending on your configuration.

Cleans and preprocesses data (missing values, scaling, feature extraction)

Supports multiple ML/DL models:

LSTM / GRU (RNN models)

Random Forest

XGBoost

Linear Regression

ARIMA / SARIMA

Visualizes:

Actual vs. predicted prices

Moving averages
